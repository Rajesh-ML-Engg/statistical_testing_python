## **``Statistical Testing``** :: ``Using Pen, Paper, Python and Excel``
##### **This repository is created for storing the components of Statistical Tests carried out on One, Two and Three or more populations using Python. Here, I have also worked on some of the real-life datasets to perform Statistical or Hypothesis Testing.**

##### **Also, shared the `hand-written notes` & `python implementations` which I created to attain better knowledge around these tests.**

:diving_mask: **``Fun-Fact``** :: ***Why I wrote some of these statistical tests from scratch?*** :man_shrugging:
- It was not only my eagerness to gain a full understanding but python statistical packages (like statsmodels and others) were following slightly different mathematical formulations for these tests. 
- So, I was getting a noticeable difference while comparing my on-paper calculated p-values with python-generated p-values. That motivated me to look into the `statsmodels` implementations and find such differences. :innocent:
